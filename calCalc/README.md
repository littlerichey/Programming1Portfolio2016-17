# Calorie Counter
This proposed program would ask the user to input general physiological information about themselves. This includes, height, weight, activity, gender, etc. The program uses these factors to determine a recommended daily calorie intake. A logging feature for calorie intake may also be included, if we can figure out a way to export and load data from/into the program. Later into development, we may also upgrade the calorie intake logger with a list of common foods. Using an API, the program will be able to determine the calories of the food and log it automatically.
